            This is a C8 - or eighth generation - Corvette. Intended to be released in 2019 but delayed to 2020 due to labor strikes, the '20-now Corvette suceeded the 2014-2019 C7 Corvette and was a complete reinvention of America's sports car. For the first time ever, the Corvette was made mid-engine (the engine located behind the cockpit), setting the car up to compete against European supercars rather than American muscle.

        A mid-engine Corvette had been actually been conceptualized for decades. Zora Arkus-Duntov, the "father" of the Corvette, joined Chevrolet in 1953 soon after the launch of the C1 Corvette. Zora progressed up the career ladder and would make his name heard when the iconic C2 came out. Though he had acheived his goals of making the Corvette a performance vehicle, Zora dreamed of a mid-engine Corvette and made many prototypes, though he retired in 1975 with his dream unfulfilled.

        At ~3650 pounds, the C8 gained a lot of weight even coming from the ~3300 pound C7, though this can be attributed to the more complex engineering needed for a mid-engine vehicle in addition to a rigid aluminum frame. Still yet, the C8 is one of the best, if not the best, handling Corvette ever. The new standard LT2 engine in the C8 makes 495 horsepower (a unit of power for cars; a Honda Civic makes ~180 hp), a modest bump up from the C7 LT1's 460 hp. The LT6 in the track-focused ZR1 makes 670 hp,  while the LT7 in the powerhouse ZR1 envelops a monstrous 1,064 hp, the most powerful production V8 ever produced.

        The C8 also introduces hybrid electric powertrains to the Corvette. The E-Ray pairs the LT2 with a 160 hp electric motor for a combined total of 650 hp. The "widowmaker" ZR1X pairs the LT7 with the E-Ray's motors to achieve 1,250 hp.
